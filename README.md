# React Profile Screen Project

This React application is a simple profile screen that renders information about the fictional character Tony stark, famously known as Iron man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The project uses hardcoded profile data stored in a local JSON file to display details about Tony stark and explore information about Marvel movies post the introduction of the Multiverse concept in Phase 5.

## Project Overview

### About Component

The **About Component** displays information about Tony stark. Users can explore details such as his biography, interests, or any other relevant information. The content is statically rendered using data stored in a local JSON file.

### Posts Component

The **Posts Component** provides information about Marvel movies, specifically focusing on details introduced in Phase 5 related to the Multiverse concept. Users can find posts or sections dedicated to different Marvel movies and their connections to the Multiverse concept. Similar to the **About Component**, the data is hardcoded and sourced from a local JSON file.

### Components Folder

The **Components Folder** is an organizational structure that houses React components. This best practice helps in maintaining a clean and scalable project structure.

## Project Structure


- **App.js:** The main component where **About** and **Posts** components are imported and utilized.
- **data.json:** The local JSON file containing hardcoded profile data, utilized by the **About** and **Posts** components.
